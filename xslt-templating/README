Can we use XSL-T to templating on server and client side for big web applications?

What are my expectations?

* Any or light template render process on server.
* Only needed data will be send to client.
* Template files orders data that are going to read and send.(lazy load) So, no data will be read if template not get.
* URL addresses must define dynamically on templates.
* Has multi-language support.
* Browser cache-free.
* XMLs and XSLs must be minified on production.
* Ability to render on server based on user agent. For example; ability to send HTML version to Google-Bot.

Ideas

* Widgets responses all data structure but only authenticated values are filled.
* XSL documents for views can be built dynamically on server side.
